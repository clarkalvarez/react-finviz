# Finviz Frontend

This project was made to show necessary data coming from this endpoint https://github.com/clarkalvarez/react-finviz-backend

Right now the backend api should start only on local since it has a bunch of workloads for web scraping the necessary data from https://finviz.com/ and I still do not have money to support the needed fees in making it serverless
